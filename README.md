# TrueJ
The TrueJ language applies the Variable-Value approach, but attempts to stay as much like Java as is
feasible.

The website is at http://truej-lang.org.

The best place to get a feel for the language is currently 
the [Cucumber readable specifications](src/test/resources/tlang/Features/Spec%20Features/). 
The [latest results of testing against the specifications](https://Variable-Value.github.io) 
are less convenient for reading.
