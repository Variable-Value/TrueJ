/** Contains facts about some consistent world. Represented as a list of consistent, first-order
 * predicate logic facts. A new fact can be checked to
 * either see if it is consistent with the current facts or if it can be proven from the current
 * facts.
 * <p>
 * The KnowledgeBase does not syntax check the facts that it is given, but the prover uses the
 * following language:
 *
 * <h4> KnowledgeBase operators</h4>
 *      <h5>least sticky dominates an expression, as in Prolog</h5>
 * <p>
 * <h5> Right associative unless noted </h5>
 * <dl><dt> A === B, A =#= B
 *       <dd> Logical equivalence and inequivalence of boolean expressions. Equivalence is
 *            associative, not conjunctive, see below. Inequivalence can also be thought of as
 *            exclusive disjunction (<code>xor</code>). Both are left associative.
 *     <dt> A ==> B, A <== B
 *       <dd> Implication, "A implies B", and consequence, "A if B". Both are
 *            left associative.
 *     <dt> A \/ B       <dd> Disjunction, "or"
 *     <dt> A /\ B       <dd> Conjunction, "and"
 *     <dt> (a = b)      <dd> Equals; a and b may be substituted for one another.
 *                            Use <code> = </code> to compare objects and <code> === </code> to
 *                            compare logical expressions.
 *                            Unfortunately, because of implementation issues, an equality
 *                            expression must always be enclosed in parentheses,
 *                            <code>(a = b)</code>.
 *     <dt> a #= b       <dd> Not equal
 *     <dt> -A           <dd> Logical negation; "not A"
 *     <dt> false, true  <dd> The logical constants
 *     <dt>
 * </dl>
 *
 * <h4> Relations and functions </h4>
 * Relations and functions look the same, but are conceptually different. Both are written as any
 * java identifier beginning with a lower-case letter and followed by a list of any number of
 * parenthesized objects. But relations are are either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> while
 * functions may have any kind of value. Therefore we might have relations <code>isHusband(x)</code>
 * and <code>hasChildren(x)</code> and write statements which may or may not be true like
 * <code>isHusband(x) === hasChildren(x)</code>.
 * We might have functions at the same time of
 * <code>salary(person)</code> and <code>spentToday(person)</code>, and write wish to prove
 * statements like<code>(salary(x) = spentToday(x))</code>. Because <code>=</code> is an operator
 * whose value might be either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>, we can also write the
 * possible fact <code>isHusband(x) === (salary(x) = spentToday(x))</code>.
 * <p>
 * In Java, <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> are just different values that methods may
 * produce, but the implementation of the prover makes it simpler to keep them separate. if we want
 * <code>keepsSecrets(x)</code> to be defined to be always <code>true</code>, it is more convenient
 * to define <code>keepsSecrets(x)</code> as a relation using <code>keepsSecrets(x) === true</code>
 * and write <code>isHusband(x) === keepsSecrets(x)</code> because if we define it as a function
 * with a truth value result, using equality instead of equivalence,
 * <code>keepsSecrets(x) = true</code>, the prover forces us to awkwardly write
 * <code>isHusband(x) === (keepsSecrets(x) = true)</code>. (No husbands were injured during the
 * construction of these examples.)
 *
 * <h4> Logical quantifiers </h4>
 * <dl><dt> all(X,p(X))
 *       <dd> The universal quantifier: For all <code>X</code>, <code>p(X)</code> is true. Here,
 *            <code>X</code> stands for any Prolog variable name, a string of letters, digits,
 *            or underscores beginning with a capital letter or underscore. And
 *            <code>p(X)</code> stands for any expression containing <code>X</code>.
 *     <dt> all(X, range-of(X), body(X))
 *       <dd> For all <code>X</code> where <code>range-of(X)</code> is true, <code>body(X)</code> is
 *            true. Here, <code>X</code> stands for any Prolog variable name, that is, a string of
 *            letters, digits, or underscores beginning with a capital letter or underscore. And
 *            <code>range-of(X)</code> and <code>body(X)</code> stand for any expressions containing
 *            <code>X</code>. Although it just means <code>all(X, range-of(X) ==> body(X))</code>,
 *            it's a convenient way to give a type or other restriction for the quantified variable,
 *            as in <code>all(N, (type(integer,N) /\ N #= 0), square(N) > 0)</code> or
 *            <code>all(Employee, type(partTime,Employee), paidBiweekly(Employee))</code>.
 *     <dt> ex(X,p(X))
 *       <dd> Existential quantification. For all <code>X</code>, <code>p(X)</code> is true.
 *     <dt> ex(X, range-of(X), body(X))
 *       <dd> For all <code>X</code> where <code>range-of(X)</code> is true, <code>body(X)</code> is
 *            true. This is equivalent to <code>ex(X, range-of(X) /\ body(X))</code>
 * </dl>
 *
 * <h4> A Note on Associativity of logical operators - none are conjunctive </h4>
 *
 * <dl><dt> A === B      <dd> Logical equivalence of predicates; associative.
 *     <dt> A =#= B      <dd> Inequivalence for boolean expressions; exclusive disjunction (xor)
 *                            (Left associative)
 *     <dt> A ==> B      <dd> Implication, "A implies B" (Left associative)
 *     <dt> A <== B      <dd> Consequence, "A if B" (Left associative)
 * </dl>
 * <p>
 * Do not chain the logical operators together, for instance, avoid <code>A ==> B ==> C</code>
 * because it means if <code>A ==> B</code> then <code>C</code>. And logical equivalence is
 * associative, not conjunctive (chaining). For instance, the following are
 * all the same:
 * <dl><dt> ((p===q) === r) === (p === (q===r))
 *       <dd> Which is the Law of Associativity of Equivalence
 *       <p>
 *     <dt> (p===q) === (r===p) === (q===r)
 *       <dd> This leaves some parentheses out, so we can read it either as
 *            <ul><li>(p===q) is the same as (r===p), if and only if (q===r), or as
 *                <li>(p===q), if and only if (r===p) is the same as (q===r)
 *            </ul>
 *     <dt> p === q === r === p === q === r
 *       <dd> Parenthesize this any way you like, it all means the same thing.</dd>
 * </dl>
 *<p>
 * The last two can be confusing. Liberal use of parentheses are recommended, or perhaps adding
 * extra spaces around some === to give them extra visual weight.
 * <p>
 * Since we mentioned
 * conjunctivity, perhaps we need to also mention that equality <code>=</code> is not
 * conjunctive either, and in fact, must always be enclosed in parentheses, as in
 * <code>(a = successor(b))</code>.
