%%%                     Email: cowan@acm.org
%%% Based on the predicate calculus prover by
%%% Bernhard Beckert & Joachim Posegga, Copyright (C) 1993:

%%%
%%% (Types are not yet fully implemented. They will be implemented once
%%% T-language tests require them.)
%%%
%%% Types are considered to be a set of predicates, possibly including
%%% additional type "declarations", which are simply predicates declaring that a
%%% name within the scope of the enclosing type has a particular type.
%%%
%%% Besides adding types and equality, a major change is that etleantap.pl has
%%% three possible outcomes: inconsistent, consistent, and ambiguous. An
%%% ambigious outcome occurs when processing is abandoned because a depth limit
%%% is reached. When this happens in an OR-branch, processing is abandoned since
%%% there is no possibility of proving inconsistency. Proving consistency is
%%% still possible, but we are not so interested in that. When processing is
%%% abandoned in one conjunct of an AND-expression, there is still the
%%% possibility of proving inconsistency in the other branch, so it is explored,
%%% but proving consistency is no longer possible.
%%%
%%% In addition, the previous copy of an ALL-expression is checked to make sure
%%% that it has been used before adding another copy. This greatly reduces
%%% trivial depth expansion.

%% inconsistent(+Formula, +GuardedExpressionExpansionLimit, +TextOfFormula)
%%
%% Starts the prover. To prove a statement is valid, that is, true for all
%% possible values of its variables, the Formula submitted should
%% be the negation of the statement to be proven. If the Formula is consistent
%% (that is, the proof of the negation of the formula fails), a message is
%% printed.
%%
%% TODO: add a fourth parameter that returns a clear signal as to why the
%%       prover stopped: inconsistent, consistent, or unresolved
%%
%% A branch can refuse to close because there was no action to take; if there
%% are no alternatives to explore, this indicates that the Formula is
%% consistent. The Formula is also consistent if the prover loops forever, but
%% if a branch reaches the maximum number of free variables that are
%% allowed then the prover stops in an ambigious situation: a higher limit
%% could possibly allow the prover to show that the statement is inconsistent
%% (that is negation is provably true).
%%
%% We will need to print a msg such as:
%%
%%    Proof failed for XXX. Either it is
%%    inconsistent with the information provided or its proof depends on
%%    information that has not been given. Consider adding to the
%%    constraints, given-statement, or program statements.
%%
%% Or a msg such as
%%    Proof failed for XXX because the length or time was exceeded. If the
%%    statement is true, you may be able to prove it by adding to the
%%    constraints, given-statement, or program statements. An alternative is

%% inconsistent(+Fml,+UnExp,+Lits,+FreeV,+Guarded,+DepthLeft)
%%
%% succeeds if there is a closed tableau for Fml with not more than DepthLeft
%% expansions of Unexplored expressions from guarded expressions on each
%% sub-branch. This is implemented as succeeding if any member of the UnExp list
%% is inconsistent with any other member.
%%
%%  Fml: formula in skolemized negation normal form that will be tested for
%%       inconsistency, that is, an attempt will be made to prove that its
%%       negation is true.
%%       syntax:      negation: '-', disj: ';', conj: ','
%%       quantifiers: all(X,<Formula>), where 'X' is a prolog variable that
%%       occurs in <Formula>. This form of the all statement is translated to an
%%       implementation that has three parameters, all(X,<Formula>,LastVar),
%%       with the addition of LastVar. The all-statement is placed back at the
%%       end of the list of unexplored expressions after the <Formula> is copied
%%       with a fresh variable for X that acts as a free variable in the copy.
%%       LastVar is the free variable from the previous copy of the <Formula>.
%%       If LastVar is a variable then that free variable for the previous copy
%%       of the <Formula> has not been matched, and, therefore, there is nothing
%%       to be accomplished by making another copy because the previous copy is
%%       on the literals list and can match anything that the new copy would
%%       match.
%%
%%     The <Formula> may have the following special forms which are processed by
%%     moving the full guarded expression to the guarded list:
%%       guarded(hasType(T,<X>), ExpressionWithX)
%%       guarded(EqMatch, ExpressionWithX) - where EqMatch is either an
%%           equality term that includes the variable <X>, such as <X>=B, or an
%%           inequality term, such as -(<X>=B) a guarded fact.
%%
%%     If the Fml is a literal that is not a guarded expression, and it doesn't
%%     close the branch, then it is matched with a fresh copy of the guards of
%%     the guarded expressions and any resulting newly-bound ExpressionWithX is
%%     placed in the unexamined list before the Fml is added to the literal
%%     list. There is no need to test a new
%%     equality guard against all the previously processed literals because any
%%     previously processed equality literal would have invoked a guarded
%%     statement when it was processed that the current equality would have
%%     matched, ending its processing.
%%
%%     Although the current version uses guarded expressions only for
%%     implementing equality, it should also be sufficient for implementing
%%     types. Type definitions will be asserted as guarded expression rules.
%%     Then every time a variable is defined with a type, a search for a guard
%%     with type(VarName,TypeDefinition) will be performed. If the
%%     TypeDefinition expression contains the definition of an enclosed-type /
%%     inner-class, then that will be placed on the Guarded list. Notice that
%%     this does not allow for deducing that an element has a particular type,
%%     but that is not required for proofs of a Java-like language as all
%%     variables are declared with all the typing that they are allowed to use.
%%
%%     When the nnf.prolog encounters a typed all, all(X,type(X,T),Expression),
%%     it is responsible for translating it to a guarded expression,
%%     guarded(type(X,T),Expression) and asserting it as a new rule.
%%
%%       Perhaps in later versions, a type may declare
%%             guardedOp(Op,MatchExpr)
%%         such as
%%             guardedOp('<',X < Y)
%%         to show the intention to use a guarded expression for that operator
%%         or predicate. This will allow the definition of transitivity,
%%         monotonicity, and substitution rules for other relational operators
%%         without incurring the cost of branching in the tableau. Although it
%%         is not needed for types and equalities, new guarded-Ops may need the
%%         following: if a guard generated from a guard contains an unbound
%%         variable, every expression in the literals list is matched against it
%%         so that order of expansion is not an issue.
%%
%%  UnExp:     list of formula not yet expanded to literal form and tested for
%%             inconsistency. If a literal is consistent with everything so far,
%%             it is added to the Lits list.
%%  Lits:      list of literals on the current branch that so far are mutually
%%             consistent.
%%  FreeV      List of free variables created for All-statements. It is used to
%%             ensure the continuity of all-variables in expanding nested
%%             all-statements. If, in future versions, all-statements are
%%             allowed to contain guarded expression statements, guarded
%%             expression processing will need to also account for free
%%             variables in its copying of guarded expressions.
%%  Guarded:   List of guarded expressions. Guarded expressions are a kind of
%%             one way if-statement, very similar to Prolog Horn clauses.
%%                 guarded(Guard,Expression)
%%             For all guards that are matched by the current literal, the
%%             corresponding Expressions are placed on Unexp, the list of
%%             unexplored expressions. The exception is that Expressions which
%%             are  themselves guarded expressions are immediately placed on
%%             this guarded expression list. Also, some guarded expressions are
%%             written as Prolog facts: the guarded expressions for three basic
%%             rules of the transitivity of equality are hard coded prolog
%%             facts, and type definitions are asserted as Prolog facts.
%%  DepthLeft: Number of remaining times that the search is allowed to place
%%             guarded expressions on the Unexp list. It is NOT a count of the
%%             number of guarded expressions that are placed on the Unexp list.
%%             This will prevent the search from cycling through guarded
%%             expressions that then match additional guarded expressions.
%%  UnExp:     list of formulas to be expanded to literal form and tested for
%%             inconsistency. If a literal is consistent with everything so far,
%%             it is added to the Lits list. Universally quantified statements are
%%             recycled to the end of this list for further instantiation
%%  Lits:      list of literals on the current branch that so far are mutually
%%             consistent.
%%  FreeV      List of free variables created for All-statements. It is used to
%%             ensure the continuity of all-variables in expanding nested
%%             all-statements. If, in future versions, all-statements are
%%             allowed to contain guarded expression statements, guarded
%%             expression processing will need to also account for free
%%             variables in its copying of guarded expressions.
%%  Guarded:   List of guarded expressions. Guarded expressions are a kind of
%%             one way if-statement, very similar to Prolog Horn clauses.
%%                 guarded(Guard,Expression)
%%             For all guards that are matched by the current literal, the
%%             corresponding Expressions are placed on Unexp, the list of
%%             unexplored expressions. The exception is that Expressions which
%%             are  themselves guarded expressions are immediately placed on
%%             this guarded expression list. Also, some guarded expressions are
%%             written as Prolog facts: the guarded expressions for three basic
%%             rules of the transitivity of equality are hard coded prolog
%%             facts, and type definitions are asserted as Prolog facts.
%%  DepthLeft: Number of remaining times that the search is allowed to place
%%             guarded expressions on the Unexp list. It is NOT a count of the

%%             This will prevent the search from cycling through guarded
%%             expressions that then match additional guarded expressions. Because equality uses the
%%             Guarded-list processing, the number of chained equalities is limited here.

%              Equality Facts as Guarded expressions
%
% Reflexivity, X=X, and Symmetry, X=Y <=> Y=X, are managed with procedural
% checks. But transitivity requires several guarded expressions in order to
% cover all its possible representations as implications.
% Guards are procedural implications, so each of these possible representations
% as implication must be stated as a Prolog fact.
%   ( X=Y /\ Y=Z ) => X=Z  is equivalent to -(X=Y) \/ -(Y=Z) \/ (X=Z)
% and 6 permutations of the disjuncts are possible that need to be covered with
% the guarded expressions, but it turns out that half are duplicates under
% renaming. Symmetry is accounted for in the processing of the rules.
%
% (A quirk of tuProlog findall requires using distinct variable names for
% tuprolog.version=3.0.1; apparently, a new variable number is not generated
% for each application of call(Goal) in findall(Term,Goal,Bag). )
