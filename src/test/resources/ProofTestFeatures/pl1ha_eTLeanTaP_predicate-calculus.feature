Feature: Predicate Calculus     (Tests for the eLeanTaP system)
    Copyright and license information at bottom of file.

    This file contains the tests for the axioms and theorems of the predicate
    calculus. We rely on (Gries&Schneider, 1993) in testing a complete set of
    theorems.

    The quantifiers are represented as functions "all" and "ex" taking either
    two or three arguments. The three-argument versions take a parameter for
      (1) variable name
      (2) a range predicate
      (3) the expression for the body, to which the quantification operator is
          applied when the range predicate is true.
    The three-argument statement
       all(X, range-of-X, body)
    is read as "for all X such that <range-of-X>, then <body>". For example,
       all(X, X < 0, 2*X < X).

    And
      ex (X, range-of-X, body)
    is read as "there exists an X such that <range-of-X> and <body>". For
    example,
      ex(X, even(X), squareOf(2) = X).

    The two-argument versions are
      all(X,body), meaning all(X,true, body)
      ex (X,body), meaning  ex(X,true, body)

    The range, if it is present, is intended to simplify the body by
    providing a place to limit the values that are used by the
    quantified variable.

    The three-argument versions, with ranges, may be translated into the two-
    argument versions in the following way.
      all(X,range,body) === all(X,range ==> body)
      ex (X,range,body) ===  ex(X,range /\  body)

    Some information on the prover and its language is in the feature file
    pl1aa_eLeanTap_eqivalence_truth.feature.


Background: The theorem prover is loaded into a tuProlog engine
  Given a Prolog engine
  And the eTLeanTap theory is loaded
#  And Java debugging
#  And using feature "pl1ha_eTLeanTaP_predicate-calculus"

Scenario: Simple example of a non-theorem

  When the FOP is "all(Y, all(X, p(Y) ==> p(X) ))"
  Then it is not a theorem

Scenario: Quantified variables may be given new names

    The all and ex statements bind variables locally, and the names used for
    these variables may be chosen arbitrarily, as long as the name has not
    already been used in the expression.

  * Formula "all(X, p(X)) === all(Y, p(Y))" is a theorem
  * Formula " ex(X, p(X)) ===  ex(Y, p(Y))" is a theorem


Scenario: Universal quantified variables may be instantiated to any constant

  When the FOP is "all(X, p(X)) ==> p(a) "
  Then it is a theorem

* Formula "all(X,p(X)) ==> p(a) /\ p(b) /\ p(c)" is a theorem

* Formula "(p(a) /\ p(b) /\ p(c)) \/ -all(X,p(X))" is a theorem
# same as above only all() is in last place

Scenario: Additional unnamed items do not necessarily exist

    Items must be mentioned in order for us to depend upon their existance. For
    instance, the theory of natural numbers specifically states that zero exists
    and then sets up the machinery that specifies the existence of any other
    natural number. But in general we cannot assume that things exist. So if we
    have an object, we cannot prove that there is some different object unless
    we specify it.

  * Formula "ex(X,(a#=X))" is not a theorem

  But formula "ex(X,(a=X))" is a theorem


  And formula "-ex(X,(a#=X))" is not a theorem

  But formula "ex(Y,a#=Y) ==> ex(X,(a#=X))" is a theorem


  But formula "-(a = b) ==> ex(X,-(a=X))" is a theorem


  And formula "-(a = b) ==> ex(X,-(a=X))" is a theorem

  And formula "(a=b) ==> ex(X, (a=X))" is a theorem
  * Note
    """
    This last formula can perhaps be understood as claiming that two different
    objects exist which are equal, but another interpretation is that there are
    two different names for the same object.
    """


#Scenario: We can only quantify objects, not logical statements
#
#    Um, apparantly we can do some second-order logic, but please don't -- the
#    system is not tested for that.
#
#    In first order logic, operators like ==> (implies), - (not), and \/ (or) may
#    only be used with logical statements and not with objects. The first,
#    meaningless, formula is to be read as "for all statements X and Y
#    such that statement X implies statement Y, statement X is false or
#    statement Y is true".
#
#  * Formula "all(X,all(Y,X ==> Y,-X \/ Y))" is not a theorem


Scenario Outline: Simple Examples

  When the FOP is "<Statement>"
  Then it is a "<Result>"
  * Note that "<Note>"

  # In the following tables, parenthetic numbers are a reference to the the
  # theorems collected in the final pages of David Gries & Fred B. Schneider, A
  # Logical Approach to Discrete Math, 1993. For instance, (3.8) refers to their
  # Axiom, "Definition of false".

  Examples:
    | Result    | Statement                 | Note                             |
    | theorem   | all(X,false, p) === true  | Empty Range (8.13)         |
    | theorem   |  ex(X,false, p) === false | Empty Range (8.13)         |

  # TODO: enter tests for the rest of the G&S predicate calculus theorems

Scenario: Logical quantifiers distribute over their base operators

  Forall distributes over /\ and forsome distributes over \/. Note that both /\ and \/ are
  symetric (commutative) and associative with an identity element. So distributing the forall quantifier over /\ is just rearranging the order of its base operator /\, and likewise for the forsome quantifier.

  This is Axiom 8.15 of Gries & Schneider as applied to the logical quantifiers.

  *   Formula "all(X, p(X) /\ q(X) ) === all(X, p(X)) /\ all(X, q(X))" is a theorem
  And Formula "all(X, p(X) /\ q(X) ) === all(Y, p(Y)) /\ all(Z, q(Z))" is a theorem

  And Formula "ex(X, p(X) \/ q(X) ) === ex(X, p(X)) \/ ex(X, q(X))" is a theorem
  And Formula "ex(X, p(X) \/ q(X) ) === ex(Y, p(Y)) \/ ex(Z, q(Z))" is a theorem

  But Formula "all(X, p(X) /\ q(X) ) === all(X, p(X)) \/ all(X, q(X))" is not a theorem
  And Formula  "ex(X, p(X) \/ q(X) ) ===  ex(X, p(X)) /\  ex(X, q(X))" is not a theorem

Scenario: A difficult example for some provers

  A Smullyan tree proof has difficulty with for-all-statements because they are
  reinstantiated over and over using the rule Universal Instantiation,
  generating an infinite tree. Our prover has no trouble with this because
  instead of instantiating for-all statements, we rewrite them using logic
  variables and then avoid rewriting the same for-all-statement until that logic
  variable matches something. We can't possibly find a unique use for a second
  unmatched instantiation of a statement until we have found a match for the
  first instantiation.

  The first example is taken from Zegarelli (2007, p.295-297). The second
  example is from Smullyan (1971, p.63). The idea is that the axioms for
  less-than in the natural numbers are known to be consistent; therefore, we
  should not be able to prove them false. Smullyan's example requires that we
  add the fact that every natural number has a successor and a definition for
  less-than or it runs into the problem of trying to claim something about an
  object which has no support for even existing.

  I am not yet able to prove that our trick is able to either prove or
  invalidate every formula, but it definitely reduces the number of problem
  formulas.

  If a statement is neither valid nor inconsistent, it is incomplete, in the
  sense that some other statements could be made which force it to be either
  one.
