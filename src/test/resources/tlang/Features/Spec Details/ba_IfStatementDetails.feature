Feature: If-Statement Details

  The consideration of both possible paths in an if-statement raises several issues. For instance, we allow the else-branch to be omitted, but the then-branch code cannot set any values. This is because those values would only exist conditionally and could not be counted upon to exist when we wanted to refer to them lateer in the code.

  We allow the programmer to set the condition to be always true or always false, primarily as a testing issue. If they make a mistake in writing the condition so that one branch is never taken, they are likely to have a failing declarative statement to catch the problem.

Scenario: The if statement with empty branches

  Empty branches do not accomplish anything, of course. And apparently, the meaning of a program that accomplishes nothing is "true". If you think of computational work as setting more and more facts to be one way and not another until you have what you want, then if you set so many facts that they contradict one another that would mean the whole situation is "false". Setting facts takes you closer to "false" and removing facts takes you closer to "true"; an empty set of conjoined facts means "true".

Scenario: A reference to a value name from inside a following branch is to the enclosing scope

  The branches of a conditional statement are completely independent because they are paths that are
  executed under different conditions, and therefore the code in one cannot influence the code in
  another. Thus, value names that are declared in the initial branch cannot be referenced from a
  following branch's scope. Instead, the following branch scope starts over with the original scope
  that included the conditional statement and builds from there, just as the initial branch scope
  did.
