Feature: Value names are decorated variable names (TrueJ 0.1)

  TrueJ directs the programmer's attention to the changing state of the program's data as each
  statement is executed. In procedural and object-oriented languages like Java*, variables hold the
  state, but the particular state held by those variables is never made explicit. So an important
  difference between TrueJ and Java is that we add a way for each state contained in the variables
  to be explicitly represented. And because we want programmers to easily make the transition to
  focusing more on the state and less on the variables that hold the state, we need to resist most
  of the temptations to make other changes.


Scenario: Values have names

    TrueJ represents state by adding a syntax for naming the values
    that are held by variables. We add a distinct decoration to a variable's
    name for each of the values that it stores, keeping the variable's name as
    part of the value name to allow the programmer to control details of the
    procedural programming. Within the scope of each executable, The name of the
    initial value that a variable holds is the variable name pre-decorated with
    an apostrophe, and the name of the ending value is the variable name
    post-decorated with an apostrophe. For example, the initial value of the
    variable z is named 'z and the final value is named z'. We can read 'z as
    "initial-z" and z' as "z-final".

    Once we make this transition from variable names to value names, we can show facts about program
    state as statements about values. We introduce a new statement, the means-statement to summarize
    the meaning of the preceding operations in terms of facts that have been established in the
    state.

    }
    means(a' = 'b && b' = 'a);

    } // end class
    """

  * Notes
    """
    Three comments about TrueJ's syntax and semantics will help the reader understand the example
    program above. The first is that in TrueJ, the syntax for the assignment statement is almost
    exactly the same as the notation for its semantics. For instance, when making claims about the
    program state after the assignment:
        a' = 'b;
    we use the state expression:
        a' = 'b
    and because they are essentially identical the programmer can choose to read off the meaning of
    the statement instead of its operational action. That is, instead of reading "copy the value in
    variable b to a", or "the variable a gets the value in b", or "the variable a now has the same
    value as the variable b", or "the variable a can now be substituted for the expression b in
    prior statements", the programmer can now abandon mechanical metaphors, transient truths about
    variables, and substitution of variables and expressions, and instead think about unchanging
    truths about values, reading off the meaning of the statement "a' = 'b;" as "a-final equals
    initial-b".

    The second comment is that TrueJ gives up Java's ability to include
    a side-effect-like internal assignment inside an arbitrary expression in
    exchange for unifying the syntax of three uses of equality:

      - equality resulting from an assigment statement
      - equality tests in conditional expressions
      - equality in claims about program state

    They all use the single equal sign '='. It will have to be emphasized to new programmers that
    the new value name must be on the left-hand side of an assigment, and no new value names may
    occur on the right-hand side. It is an empirical question as to which will weigh the most: the
    confusion caused by this operational vs. semantic asymmetry/symmetry, or the simplified
    understanding from using the equality symbol to point to the meaning of the assignment. The
    uncomfortable itch that some of us feel in overloading the same symbol for these distinct uses
    is one clue, but the satisfaction in easily reading off the meaning of the assignment is
    another. I hesitate to begin exploring the other solution, which is to allow the assignment
    statement to be symmetrical, because it moves further down the slippery slope that takes us away
    from Java.

    The third, and more dramatic, comment is that working with a consistent name for each value
    simplifies our understanding of the overall program's meaning. As you might have noted, in the
    code inside the swap() method, the means-statement is wasted verbage:

        int startingA' = 'a;
        a' = 'b;
        b' = startingA';

        means(startingA' = 'a && a' = 'b && b' = startingA');

    It is simply the meaning of each of the statements, combined with an "and". Once we use values
    instead of variables, the semantics of a program's top-level sequential statements is
    conjunction.

    This brings us closer to our goal of helping programmers think in terms of state as well as
    operations because the conjunction of statements over values provides a simple semantics for
    understanding the cumulative change in state created by those operations. People understand
    conjuction, so we will attempt to dispense with a discussion of inference rules for combining
    statements in all but the most advanced discussions of TrueJ. Of course, we appreciate the
    clarity that we gain from formal mathematical descriptions of the use of variables or machine
    storage locations during program execution; we only claim that this simpler mathematics is more
    helpful for writing programs.

    Functional and logic programming languages also focus on values, but at the expense of
    increasing the conceptual distance from the procedural instructions of the programmers mental
    model of the underlying machine that runs the programs (but see Chisnall, 2018).

    A careful look at the above program also raises the issue of the scope of
    the value names. Within the means-statements we use the initial value 'a,
    even though that value is no longer present in any variable -- it has been
    overwritten by the statement
       a' = 'b;
    So it seems that the scope of a value has to continue after the value ceases to exist, at least
    for logic statements. Should we allow the overwritten value to be used in the logic statements,
    but not the operational statements? We seem to have two uncomfortable options. The first is that
    we make sure that programmers understand that only values that exist can be mentioned in
    operational statements, but that values that no longer exist can be mentioned in logic. The
    alternative, and the option that TrueJ uses, is to allow the values to be reused in both code
    and descriptions of state. We make this explicit in the following scenario.
    """


Scenario: The scope of a value name ends with the scope of its variable

    Normally in a procedural language, the value held by a variable disappears
    when you overwrite it with a new value, but not in TrueJ. If you need a value
    whose variable is still in scope, the compiler will make sure the value
    still exists. Obviously, the implementation must keep a copy of any
    overwritten values that are needed for later statements.

    The link between variables and their values becomes more abstract, but we
    hope to wave that issue away for beginning programmers by saying,
    "Obviously, the implementation must keep a copy of any overwritten values
    that are needed for later statements".

    The reason that we go to the trouble to allow the use of overwritten values in TrueJ is that our
    state-based focus will often require us to make claims about how the current state relates to an
    earlier one, and we don't want to confuse beginning programmers with a different rule about
    using value names in operational statements vs. using them in claims about state. TrueJ makes
    the scope of overwritten values the same in both logic statements and operational statements by
    introducing the rule that the scope of a value begins with its definition and ends with the end
    of the scope of its variable.

    This feature embarasses me a little because, above, I was fussy over the conceptual distance of
    functional and logic languages from the procedural nature of the computer, and here we are,
    hiding a variable to hold the copy of the overwritten value and hiding the copy operation
    itself. My only defense is that it seems the best compromise if our primary goal is to integrate
    state and process.

    The ability to refer back to values that have been overwritten will only simplify program code a
    little, but the readability of programs is so important that this bit of simplification is still
    a worthwhile contribution of TrueJ. At any rate, for some programs, reusing old values does
    wonders. For instance, the semantics of the swap() method becomes so obvious from the code that
    writing it out as a separate means-statement adds useless verbage and detracts from its
    readability; instead, we just let the compiler infer the meaning of the method.

  * A valid run unit is
    """
    class Swapper2 {

    int a, b;

    void swap() {
      a' = 'b;
      b' = 'a;   // OK to use value 'a because the variable a is still in scope
    }

    } // end class
    """

  * Note
  """
  Some other languages gain a similar simplification by allowing assignment of
  multiple values to corresponding variables in a single assignment statement.
  For example,

    a, b := b, a;

  which also requires a hidden copying of values.
  """

    }
    means(startingA' = 'a && a' = 'b && b' = startingA');
       // startingA' value is out of scope here, outside the method's block,
       // because its variable startingA is declared inside the block

    } // end class
    """

  Then an error message contains
    """
    Variable startingA has not been defined in this scope
    """


Scenario: Intermediate value names use middle decoration

    Because the value of a variable may change more than once in a method, a way of naming the
    intermediate values is needed. This is accomplished by appending an apostrophe and additional
    name continuation characters. For instance lovely'14, lovely'temp2, or lovely'Mary could all be
    middle-decorated intermediate values of the variable named "lovely".

    We end up with the pleasant conceit that a variable's pre-execution value is
    pre-decorated, any mid-execution values are mid-decorated, and its post-
    execution value is post-decorated.

  * A valid run unit is
    """
    class AllTrue {

    boolean a, b, c;

      allTrue'thruB = allTrue'thruA && 'b;
      allTrue'      = allTrue'thruB && 'c;
    }
    means(allTrue' = ('a && 'b && 'c));    // equality is stickier than &&

    } // end class
    """


Scenario: Using value names allows proving logical statements

    A means-statement uses value names in fist-order predicate logic statements. It consists of only
    those things that can be deduced from operational statements and logic statements that occured
    earlier in the code. From a code execution point of view, by the time that any execution path
    through the code reaches it, the means-statement must be true.

    Logic statements are not just for helping programmers understand a program;
    it is a compiler error to have a means-statement that cannot be proven. The
    compiler must only prove valid statements, but cannot be guaranteed to prove
    all valid statements, so the programmer will sometimes need to help the
    prover by providing intermediate steps.

    In other features, we will have a lot more to say about making automated proofs useful to
    programmers and about the constraints that are placed on a prover when it is part of a compiler.

    """
    class Swapper4 {

    int a, b;

    }
    means(a' = 'b && b' = 'b); // error here

  Then an error message contains

    The code does not support the proof of the statement: b' = 'b

  Previous Research

  The use of Tony Hoare's logic (1969) to prove the correctness of programs often uses proof
  outlines, that is, assertions embedded in code -- not to check for errors during program
  execution, like the Java assert-statement, but to aid the construction of a proof of correctness
  and help programmers see the correctness as they read the code. These assertions were used soon
  after Hoare's logic paper, for instance (Hoare, 1971). The name "proof outline" seems to have
  been first used in publication by Owicki and Gries (1976). Fred Schneider (1995) gives a thorough
  explanation of them and summarizes their history. The means-statement of TrueJ was originally
  developed as a way to include proof outlines as an integral part of a language. This would
  balance the lopsided view of procedural programming languages as just a sequence of operations
  and encourage the programmer to focus just as much on the state as on the procedural operations.
  Because the Java assert-statement has a purely operational meaning, "means" was chosen to name
  the assertions, to call attention to the semantics of operations as changes to the state. But it
  quickly became clear that inserting a means-statement between every pair of operations just
  repeated the meaning of the operations, and in addition trivially repeated most of the syntax of
  the operations. Combined with a reading of Hener (1984), this led to thinking of each operation
  as having a predicate-calculus meaning, which led to backfitting the variable decorators from the
  means-statements into the operations in order to expose the fact that operations are also
  expressions in the predicate-calculus, which only worked when a naming convention was found that
  completely distinguished value names from variable names. This led to code syntax that encouraged
  a statement-by-statement focus on the changing state of the executing program. Non-operational
  logic statements are only needed in TrueJ when the facts that are stated by the operations need to
  be clarified, summarized, or restated as new concepts.

  Auxiliary variables, also called history variables or fixed variables, were introduced by Clint
  (???) and have become a standard part of proving program correctness (Hoare, 1969; Gries, 19??;
  Dijkstra, ????). The value of an auxiliary variable never changes; therefore, in our terminology,
  auxiliary variables are value names that are lexically independent of the variables that hold, or
  once held, the value. Alternatively, the value names of TrueJ could be considered to be a
  convention for naming and using auxiliary variables. However, previous work has only used
  auxiliary variables in comments and proofs of correctness, whereas value names are included as
  part of the TrueJ syntax and, as well as aiding in proofs, are used to draw the attention of the
  programmer to changes in state as part of the normal coding process.

  Decorated variables have been used to identify a particular value of the variable by almost every
  computer scientist who has struggled with program semantics (and long before that by
  mathematicians and physicists describing change). A post-decorated variable name has been used to
  denote the initial value of a variable by some and the final value by others, leaving the other
  value to be denoted by the variable name without any decoration. The Eifel language () also
  includes a syntax for the initial value of a variable in post-conditions of methods. This
  overloaded use of one name for both a variable and one of its values causes no problems when
  describing a single state of the program. In order to describe states across multiple points in
  the code, TrueJ clearly distinguishes between variables and values and brings the decoration
  tactic into the syntax of the language.

  Ward Maurer found a way to use the simple conjunction of statements in his
  modification index method (1977). He noted the advantage of post-decorating
  storage location names and variable names with integers to distinguish all the
  values of a variable while proving program correctness. The consistency of the
  relationship between a decorated name and a value throughout a program allowed
  Maurer to simplify construction of verification conditions for proofs using
  ordinary conjunction. Of course, program proof and program semantics are
  intertwined concepts, but Mauer never seems to have reflected on the
  implications of his work for program semantics. As in Maurer's work, TrueJ
  takes advantage of the use of values in interacting with a prover.

  Single assignment languages identify the concepts of variable and value by requiring a new
  variable name at each assignment (Tesler and Enea, 1968), whereas TrueJ requires a new value name
  to be associated with a variable at each assignment. Some single assignment languages allow
  statements to be entered in any order, since unique variable names can be used to sort statements
  into a correct execution order, but TrueJ requires the programmer to specify the execution order
  and merely checks that no names are used out of order.

  The static single assignment (SSA) intermediate representation for languages assigns a modified
  variable name to every unique value of a variable. It is used in compiler writing (Rosen, et. al,
  1988) to simplify static analysis for code optimization. One might think of TrueJ as repurposing
  SSA for program understanding in order to simplify the job of programmers instead of compilers.

  Eric Hehner showed that programs are predicates (Hehner, 19??; Hoare and Hanna, 19??; Hoare,
  19??). TrueJ explores this idea with a first-order predicate logic that uses only value names,
  abandoning the complications of programming variables that can change value in the middle of
  solving a problem.

  Hoare logic and the "programs are predicates" approach provides a firm mathematical foundation for
  understanding programming variables. The tradition in this type of mathematical analysis is to use
  the same name for a variable and for one of its values, which works well for stating predicates
  that only refer to a single state, but complicates the formalization of assignment and of
  sequential composition of separately analyzed program sections. The added complication for
  sequential composition is that renaming is required in order to synchronize the variable/value
  names after one operation with the beginning of the next, which requires additional proof steps.
  The use of value names in TrueJ makes this additional mental baggage disappear. However, as we
  explore more features of TrueJ, we will require the programmer to name the initial and final
  values for variables that change within a method or programming construct, and there is a sense in
  which this use of TrueJ's value names are simply a way of solving the equations for sequential
  composition that are given by Hehner and Hoare, which is as we expect since its all just
  mathematics. We merely wish to pose the empirical hypothesis that TrueJ's notation will help the
  programmer see what is true about the state as the program executes, that is, see what the program
  means.


  Conclusion

  TrueJ provides a syntax for naming values as well as variables in a
  Java-like programming language. Because the syntax of an operation is
  expressed with named constant values, we do not need to invent a special logic
  to help us keep track of the changing values held by variables. This allows
  the programmer to see that every operation is itself a logic statement which
  relates the state before the operation to the state after. And because
  operations are predicates, we are able to see that the meaning of a sequence
  of operations is simply their conjunction.

  It can be hoped that drawing the attention of the programmer to changes in state with value names
  and integrating a prover into the compiler will lead to a practical fulfillment of the idea of
  constructing programs in parallel with their proofs of correctness (?Dijktra?, ????). Indeed, it
  looks like they are they are one and the same task, and TrueJ can be thought of as a syntax that
  shows that programs are proofs (????).

  Ah, well, we do realize that we have demonstrated this grand idea only for those programs that are
  a simple sequence of assignments -- we will cover the complications introduced by control
  structures, method calls, object orientation, aliasing, concurrency, proofs of correctness, and
  the use of interfaces for program specification in separate feature descriptions.
