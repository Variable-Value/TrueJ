Feature: Methods

  The _given_-statement guards an executable section of code, that is, a method, constructor, or
  initializer block of a class, and ensures that the executable is only invoked in a context in
  which it will be appropriate. A _given_-statement is proven to be true, not at the point at which
  it is coded, but at every point where code invokes the executable that it guards.
